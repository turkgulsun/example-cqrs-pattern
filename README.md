CQRS Pattern Demonstration .NET 8 Web Application
This repository contains a .NET 8 web application that demonstrates how to implement the CQRS pattern. The application utilizes a variety of modern software development techniques, including MediatR and Domain Driven Design (DDD).

Technologies<br>
.NET 8 <br>
C#<br>
PostgreSQL<br>
Docker<br>
docker-compose.yml<br>
MediatR<br>
Domain Driven Design (DDD)<br>

<br>Setup<br>
<br>
Start the application by running the following command:

docker-compose up<br>
<br>
Update the database by running the following command:
<br><br>
cd Infrastructure<br>
dotnet ef database update<br>

<br>
Usage
The application currently does not expose an API. You can explore the codebase to see how the CQRS pattern is implemented.<br>

What is the CQRS Pattern?<br><br>
Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a software architectural pattern that separates commands and queries into different objects and processes. This can make applications more scalable, flexible, and maintainable.<br>

In CQRS, commands are handled by command handlers. Command handlers translate commands into operations that modify the system's state. Queries are handled by query handlers. Query handlers are operations that read the system's state and return the query result.

What's in this Repository?<br>
This repository contains a set of example code that demonstrates how to implement the CQRS pattern. The examples include:<br>

Commands and command handlers<br>
Queries and query handlers<br>
Domain models<br>
Data access objects<br>
